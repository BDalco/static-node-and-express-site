# static-node-and-express-site
In this project, I created a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects I have built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where I share contact info and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least my first five projects.

I created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created. I also altered the CSS to add some extra style to the page by adding animations to the images, a hover state to the thumbnail project images and a hover state to the button.

I used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I used Node.js and Express to:
• Import the required dependencies
• Link the JSON with the Pug templates
• Set up routes to handle requests
• Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
• Handle errors
• Set up a server to serve the project
